            <p>Storjcoin X (SJCX) is a digital currency that runs on the <a href="http://counterparty.co/" class="link">Counterparty</a> and Bitcoin protocol. Only 500 million will ever exist. Earn it by renting out your excess hard drive space with <a href="http://driveshare.org/" class="link">DriveShare</a>, or use it to purchase space on the <a href="http://storj.io" class="link">Storj</a> network with <a href="http://metadisk.org/" class="link">Metadisk</a>.</p>

            <h3>How do rewards work?</h3>
            <p>For Test Group B, your uptime and space shared are tracked. You are then paid for your performance relative to the network at the end of the month. All payments are posted publicly <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZYzMrW0i4qtonDIjk3pfwkKv6rHCOuUc7rUurIRPqU/edit#gid=0" class="link">here</a>, and paid a few days after.</p>

            <h3>Why is 10,000 SJCX needed?</h3>
            <p>Any SJCX address can participate for testing purposes, but to receive a reward holding a 10,000 SJCX balance is required. SJCX, our digital currency, is your license to store files. You gain it by providing good service, and lose it when you don't.</p>

                    <p>Rewards have been implemented during the testing process of the Storj applications.  Rewards will be advertised but the breakdown and rules governing are subject to change as the project evolves.  Rewards are present to provide motivation/incentive for participation in the tests.  Rewards are NOT payment for testing.  Rewards are NOT equivalent to mining rewards.</p>

                    <p>At the present time each payout address must have a minimum of 10,000 SJCX to qualify for rewards and upon request any address that was not affiliated with the crowdsale, will have to have 10,000 SJCX donated to the rewards pool to qualify for future rewards.  There is NO guarantee of rewards equaling or exceeding the 10,000 SJCX donation.</p>

                    <p>Rewards are calculated using a fair methodology that looks at available data at the time of snapshots such as capacity and SJCX holdings and via server tracking of data such as duration of registered address, uptime and audit success.  The criteria and timing of rewards snapshots or tracking will be advertised in advance.</p>

                    <p>Rewards are an incentive provided by the developers of the Storj project to encourage participation in the testing process and should NOT be considered a form of payment or a form of return on investment.  Rewards are NOT guaranteed.  The structure of, timing of and amount of rewards are subject to change during the testing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Qualifying for Rewards – Step 1:</strong></p>
                    <p>To qualify for rewards the first step is to possess 10,000 SJCX in your payout address.  Compliance with this requirement will be tracked through <a href="http://blockscan.com" class="link">http://blockscan.com</a> and in order to ensure that you are compliant it is advised that any transactions be made 24 hours prior to any deadlines, snapshot or donations request to ensure that the transaction will appear on the blockchain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Qualifying for Rewards – Step 2a: Crowdsale Participants</strong></p>
                    <p>For those that participated in the Crowdsale, simply holding 10,000 SJCX in your payout address will qualify you for full rewards.  Holding &gt;0 but &lt;10,000 SJCX will qualify a Crowdsale participant for partial rewards.  The fraction of full rewards will be determined by the developers, but will be a maximum of the percentage of 10,000 SJCX held.</p>

                    <p><strong>Qualifying for Rewards – Step 2b: Non-Crowdsale Participants</strong></p>
                    <p>For non-crowdsale participants there will be a request for donations prior to TGB M3-2 (test group b, milestone 3, part 2).  Prior to this request, qualification for rewards is the same as for crowdsale participants.  Once the request is made, qualification for rewards is dependent on a donation of 10,000 SJCX to the rewards pool.  There will be a window to donate prior to the commencement of TGB M3-2 testing & tracking.  There is NO partial rewards for non-crowdsale members.  A donation entitles a non-crowdsale participant to full rewards based on their stats.</p>

                    <p>A non-crowdsale participant does not need to both donate and hold 10K SJCX during TGB M3-2 to qualify for rewards.  Only the donation is required for rewards qualification.</p>

                    <p>There is NO guarantee that any participant, crowdsale or otherwise, will receive 10,000 SJCX (or any amount for that matter) in rewards during TGB M3-2</p>

                    <p>Policies have not been announced at the present time as to requirements for holding or donations for future test groups.  Once announced, this information will be updated.  Any statements about these policies are unofficial or speculative until announced officially.</p>

                    <p>Many users coming from the Bitcoin space ask us why we created a new token named Storjcoin X (“SJCX”). There is a mix of technical and economic reasons why we felt a new token was needed. SJCX is built with Counterparty, which uses the Bitcoin blockchain. We have plans to implement Bitcoin in the future when Storj is more stable (ideally using sidechains).</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p><b>Bitcoin is too Expensive</b> - For standard storage providers 1 GB of storage goes $0.03 per month. So what if I want to store 1 MB and do payments every hour? Each payment would be $0.000000042. One satoshi, as of time of writing, is worth $0.0000037. This means Bitcoin would place some economic restrictions on the network.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Micropayment Lockup</b> - We plan on using micropayment channels, which require locking up coins on the blockchain for the duration of the channel. We would much rather lock up lots of SJCX, than hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin while we’re still testing the protocol.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Economic Isolation</b> - Bitcoin price fluctuates heavily for a wide variety of factors. Currency volatility can directly impact the profitability of nodes, and cause problems for the network. Having a separate token that is transacted widely within the network, but has little interaction outside the network, more directly ties currency price to network health.</p></li>
